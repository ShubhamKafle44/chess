**Chess App**
**Overview**


This application is built using Python and is primarily designed to deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts, specifically in the context of game development and decision-making algorithms. The Chess App has been created from scratch to explore various aspects of chess, from how the pieces move to designing and implementing sophisticated algorithms.

**Features**
Chess Piece Movements: The app simulates the movement of chess pieces according to standard chess rules.
Minimax Algorithm: Implemented for decision-making, this algorithm allows the program to anticipate future moves and make strategic choices.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimized the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, which reduces the number of nodes that are evaluated in the game tree, resulting in faster decision-making.


**Purpose**
This project aims to enhance my knowledge in:
    Learning how to simulate chess pieces and moves programmatically.
    Understanding and applying game theory concepts like the Minimax algorithm.
    Optimizing decision-making algorithms with techniques such as alpha-beta pruning.
    Future Improvements
    Implementing more advanced AI techniques, such as neural networks, for a machine learning-based approach to chess.
    Adding features like chess clocks, difficulty levels, and multiplayer support.
**Technologies Used**
Language: Python

**Algorithm**: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
